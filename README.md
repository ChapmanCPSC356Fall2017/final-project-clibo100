# Sierra Clibourne - Final project for Android App Developent

This is an android app that will let you take notes and set reminders for yourself.

 
 
### how to work it:

To add a new note, click the add button in the upper right hand corner

To delete a note, swipe it off the screen in the list view

to see a note's description, click on the note in the list view

to edit a note, click on the note in the list view and then fill to your liking

to set a reminder, click the set reminder check box and then choose the date and time with the given dialogues

make sure you click save to save the note, going back without clicking save does not maintain changes

### known issues

although i have like 90% of the code for receiving notifications, my broadcast reciever never actually began working. what this means is that the notifications don't actually work, per se. i tried really hard, sorry.
