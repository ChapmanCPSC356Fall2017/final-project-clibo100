# Sierra Clibourne - Final project for Android App Developent

This is an android app that will let you take notes and set reminders for yourself.

 
 
known errors: 

if using instant run, sometimes a file named instant-run will show up in the notes list. deleting this file is fine

on startup if a note has a reminder, the note will have a time displayed as -08:00 instead of PST. set date fixes this somehow


TODO:

actually set up the notifications

error handling: make sure they can't pick a date/time in the past
